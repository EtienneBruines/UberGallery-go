# UberGallery-go
Based on [UberGallery/ubergallery](https://github.com/UberGallery/ubergallery/), but written in [Go](https://golang.org/) for performance

## Compatibility
Written and tested with Go 1.5. I am not supporting earlier versions, even though they might work. 

Running in production on a Debian Stretch, ARM7 server at [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/).
